# HVSR-Analysis
A Python 2.7 script to perform HVSR analysis on a time window of 3-component time series data

This is an old straightforward script that I wrote in Python 2.7 in 2016 for my MSc project. It accesses data using the filename from a specifically formatted database, and performs HVSR (Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratio) analysis on the datafile, outputting a plot of the spectra. The main module used in ObsPy.
